#### What is this?
I'm working for a web development company. Here we made a little bit large scale web application for a client. Previously that client have maintained a excell sheet to store their customer details, but after creating their web application they gave that excel sheet for us to insert that data to database. We are using AWS for server management and now we need to upload that data to AWS. 
Therefore our backend engineer told me to "design a software with any lanaguage to upload this excel sheet's text based data to local mysql database and there is a google drive link containing in some rows in excel sheet. That documents need to be download and upload to AWS S3 bucket"
He gave me a high level idea to do this and I made it : )
This works on windows and any Linux Distros. But first you need to have JRE (java runtime environment) to run this softwar. This is a CLI based software.
